# projects
TL;DR: List of personal projects to see my progress, accomplishments, and future endeavors all in the name of ~~moral support~~ encouragement.


Preface/:
This list of projects also serves as a tool for analyzing trends that will allow me to understand my ideal, potential future career.

The projects sections are all split by the year in chronological order (i.e. 2022, 2023, 2024, ...) and as of October of 2025, projects will be posted individually. (some larger past projects will get their own page)

Not all dates are fully accurate, especially those in the past.

Beware that these projects are written less formally, as if they are a part of a journal. It's entertaining for me to write and possibly entertaining for anyone who decides to check the commits for grammatical errors. Enjoy!
