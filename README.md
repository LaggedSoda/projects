# projects
TL;DR: List of projects in chronological order to see my progress, accomplishments, and future endeavors all in the name of ~~moral support~~ encouragement.


Preface:
This list of projects also serves as a tool for analyzing trends that will allow me to understand my ideal, potential future career. The projects sections are all split by the year (i.e. 2022, 2023, 2024, ...). Not all dates are fully accurate, especially those at the start since I forget exactly when I began these projects since, before that, they weren't called projects (they were for educational purposes to test myself). Today, it mostly holds the same. Beware that these projects are written less formally, as if they are a part of a journal. It's entertaining for me to write and possibly entertaining for anyone who decides to check the commits for grammatical errors. Enjoy!
