2023 was a fairly uneventful year for my projects since little was documented. Most of this year was my final years of highschool and I was working overtime to get my dual enrollments. I was working on video editing (on Windows mostly since most of the more professional software was only really supported under Windows), school projects, and troubleshooting my Arch install every once in a while.

While it is less related to technical projects, I was at my height of learning Spanish in highschool, I was working during those summers at a small meat market, and I was also helping my friends with their movie that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GZJO-PePRc). I also helped them on a holloween film that you can also watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uHMswunciM).

The only two technical feats I had done during this year were upgrading my computer (erronously) and trying to troublshoot the 3-D printer for my highschool's Science Club (of which I was told I was a founder of).

**Upgrading my Computer**

This was really the first time I was getting really down and dirty with my PC since I was replacing the CPU from a R5 2600 to a more reasonable R5 5600. I have to tell you, it was one of the most frightning things I have done in my life: taking off an AM4 cooler. It isn't a myth that those coolers like to really stick to the CPU since I remember having such an issue taking it off that I may have yanked the CPU out of the socket. However, to my surprise, this was super common and prying the CPU off of the now-unattached heatsink is just another chore.

Here are pictures of me messing with the CPU. I don't have a picture of the CPU being attached to the heatsink, but fortunately I have a recent picture of me installing a better heatsink (that isn't a stock cooler) in 2025 and I have some nice pictures of that:

**3-D Printer Troubleshooting**

There isn't much to say since we never fully troubleshooted it. But, I remember when it first came in. To our surprise, the small science club that almost consistently got 3-5 people in the final year I was there, there was a grant that gave us an H-1 3-D Printer from Afinia 3D. We spent weeks working on figuring it out from the software to making sure everything was set up correctly. We only had about 15 minutes each week during recess to get anything done except for one week were we stayed after school for about 50 minutes to see if we could figure anything out. By the end of that year, we came to the conclusion that we were sent a bad 3D printer and we didn't have much time for any other projects. Though, it was genuinely amazing to see a real 3-D printer with my very own eyes.

**Beginning of The Partition Project**

Between 2023 and 2024 during my senior year of highschool, I had a website class (not a real one, just drag pictures onto a Google Sites page) and we had to update it every week. I decided to do one about computer literacy that you can view [here](https://sites.google.com/view/thepartitionproject/home). I still have access to the site and editing it, but unfortunately I don't have access to the YouTube account where I was starting to make videos about computer-related topics (it was linked to my school account that gets sent to the shadow realm after one graduates). You can view everything from the website. The site went into 2024.


At the end of 2023, I was able to snag a 6650XT. That was an amazing upgrade.
